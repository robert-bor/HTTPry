=== GOALS WHICH WOULD BE NICE TO REACH ===
* ability to change the HTTP Method (ie, GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)
* ability to change the URL parameters, both in content and amount
* ability to change the Body content, also binary if possible (ie, upload?)
* ability to change both the request and the response
* filter out URLs with registered extensions
* filter in (or out), domains
* console showing total number of URLs intercepted, number of those filtered in and out

=== TESTING XUL PAGES IN THE BROWSER ===

Type this in the browser navigation bar to boot up the main page:

  chrome://httpry/content/httpry_main.xul

=== XUL NOTIFICATIONS ===

The various notifications for Mozilla Firefox can be found here:

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Observer_Notifications

=== JQUERY AND XUL ===

Add a method to the prototype class:

    loadjQuery: function(wnd){
        var loader = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/moz/jssubscript-loader;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.mozIJSSubScriptLoader);
        loader.loadSubScript("chrome://httpry/content/jquery-xul.js",wnd);
        return wnd.jQuery.noConflict(true);
    },

Have a variable '$':

    var $;

Call the prototype method from the method constructing the instance, eg:

    httpryObserver.jquery = httpryObserver.loadjQuery(window);
    $ = httpryObserver.jquery;

Now JQuery can be called from within the JavaScript. Note that not everything works as good as it does in a non-Chrome
setting. For example, when appending a child, it is better to append a DOM element then the plain text. For some reason
the plain text is converted into the DOM, but not shown. Cause unknown.
